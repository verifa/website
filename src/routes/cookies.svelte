<p>
	A cookie is a small piece of data that a website stores on your device when you visit. It
	typically contains information about the website itself, a unique identifier that allows the site
	to recognise your web browser when you return, additional data that serves the cookie’s purpose,
	and the lifespan of the cookie itself.

<p>
	Cookies are used to enable certain features (eg logging in), track site usage (eg analytics),
	store your user settings (eg time zone, notification preferences), and to personalise your content
	(eg advertising, language).

<p>
	Cookies set by the website you are visiting are usually referred to as first-party cookies. They
