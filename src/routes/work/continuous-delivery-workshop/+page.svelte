						A Value Stream Map is a visual tool showing the series of events that take a product or

					<h4>Value Stream Mapping</h4>

						Value Stream Mapping (VSM) is a method for defining a Value Stream and analysing the
						current flow in order to remove waste and to derive a more lean and continuous workflow.

					<h4>Finding Waste</h4>
					<p class="mb-0">
						Waste is any activity that consumes resources, but does not add value to the product or
						service a customer receives. Less waste means more flow.

	<Faq title="Continuous Delivery principles">
		<FaqItem question="Infinite Game"
			><p class="mb-0">
				When you fix your biggest problem, you still have a biggest problem.
			</p></FaqItem
		>
		<FaqItem question="Plan vs Do"
			><p class="mb-0">
				Set goals, but don’t spend too much time planning the details. You learn as you go, allowing
				you to adjust course better than any plan ever would. Don’t plan for more than a couple of
				weeks.
			</p></FaqItem
		>
		<FaqItem question="What vs How"
			><p class="mb-0">
				It’s not about how to do it in the tools, it’s about what you want to achieve. Don’t let the
				tools control your process.
			</p></FaqItem
		>
		<FaqItem question="Problem vs Symptom"
			><p class="mb-0">
				Symptoms are easy to see and often easy to patch, but workarounds don’t solve the underlying
				problem, they only serve to obfuscate it. Look for the underlying problem.
			</p></FaqItem
		>
		<FaqItem question="Comfort Zone"
			><p class="mb-0">
				Technology will always change and old experts will become novices. It is better to learn
				something new and fail than to stay in the comfort zone risking the business.
			</p></FaqItem
		>
		<FaqItem question="KISS"
			><p class="mb-0">
				Keep it simple stupid; a good solution removes waste. Use simple tools, reduce complexity
				and maintenance costs. A simple solution is better than a clever solution.
			</p></FaqItem
		>
		<FaqItem question="Build - Measure - Learn"
			><p class="mb-0">
				Avoid big bangs as much as possible. Test, experiment, release gradually and be ready to
				revert. Build this in as part of the process.
