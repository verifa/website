			Even with automation, building software is an inherently human undertaking and the ways 
			of working play a huge part in its success. The composition of teams, relationships and 
			interactions is an often overlooked practice when improving a continuous delivery process.

			Verifaâ€™s holistic approach, based on Team Topologies (link to TT site??), is about organising 
			technical teams in a such a way that they are able to deliver value continuously and sustainably.

		<h2>How we can help</h2>
		<p class="mb-0">
			Every team is different, and we need to understand your unique situation. The starting 
			point for this is working together with your team to conduct a Value Stream Assessment 
			(link to VSA page) to uncover your current way of working, interactions and software delivery 
			flow. Each VSA is customised but often includes:

			- item 1
			- item 2
			- item 3
			- item 4
