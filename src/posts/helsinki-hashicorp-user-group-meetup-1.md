**The newly formed Helsinki HashiCorp User Group is a quarterly** [**meetup**](https://www.meetup.com/helsinki-hashicorp-user-group) **full of interesting talks and insights about all things HashiCorp, plus a chance to connect with fellow professionals and hobbyists alike.**

Verifa was pleased to host the very first Helsinki HUG meetup on 23rd June, held online due to current circumstances. Fingers crossed we can meet in real life at the [second meetup](https://www.meetup.com/helsinki-hashicorp-user-group/events/279041155/) on 23rd September!

Here's a brief summary of the talks along with links to the presentation decks, and the full meetup recording.
