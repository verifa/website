**The newly formed Helsinki HashiCorp User Group is a quarterly meetup full of interesting talks and insights about all things HashiCorp, plus a chance to connect with fellow professionals and hobbyists alike.**

Our friends over at [Upcloud](https://upcloud.com/ "Upcloud website") were the gracious hosts for the second Helsinki HUG (HashiCorp User Group), held on 23rd September. This time HUG was held in real life, as well as online. So, as well as a couple of great presentations, in person visitors got to socialise, drink beer, eat pizza, and enjoy sauna!

Here's a brief summary of the talks along with links to the presentation decks, and the full meetup recording.
