**The newly formed Helsinki HashiCorp User Group is a quarterly meetup full of interesting talks and insights about all things HashiCorp, plus a chance to connect with fellow professionals and hobbyists alike.**

The third Helsinki HUG held on 7th December coincided with Slush, the world's leading startup event, and was an official Slush side event. This time around, Eficode was the gracious host. We gathered at their downtown offices, to listen to talks from Eficode and Supermetrics, enjoy some chit chat, snacks, drinks and sauna. The presentations were also live streamed for those joining online.

Here's a brief summary of the talks along with links to the presentation decks, and the full meetup recording.

### Helsinki HashiCorp User Group 2021 retrospective

To kick off proceedings Anoop from Verifa took a brief look back at 2021 which saw Helsinki HUG's inaugural meetup! From a seed of an idea at the start of 2021, the first meetup took place online in June streamed from Verifa's office, followed by the first in-person event in September hosted by Upcloud. And now here we are with the third meetup in December hosted by Eficode. We're pleased to see that the membership has grown from 48 people in June to 94 as of 7 December 2021. Can we reach 100 by the end of the year? Invite your all your HashiCorp-loving friends to join!
