**Helsinki HashiCorp User Group is a meetup full of interesting talks and insights about all things HashiCorp, plus a chance to connect with fellow professionals and hobbyists alike.**

Our friends over at [UpCloud](https://upcloud.com/) very kindly hosted the fifth Helsinki HUG, held on 30th November. We gathered at their downtown office to listen to talks from Verifa, UpCloud and DevOps Rob, and some zero-trust socialising! The event was also live streamed for people joining online.

Here’s a brief summary of the talks along with links to the presentation decks, and the full meetup recording.
