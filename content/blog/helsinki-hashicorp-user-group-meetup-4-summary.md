**Helsinki HashiCorp User Group is a quarterly meetup full of interesting talks and insights about all things HashiCorp, plus a chance to connect with fellow professionals and hobbyists alike.**

Our friends over at [Supermetrics](https://supermetrics.com/) very kindly hosted the fourth Helsinki HUG, held on 22nd March. We gathered at their downtown office to listen to talks from Verifa and Supermetrics, take our fill of snacks and drinks, socialise and sauna! The event was also live streamed for people joining online.

Here’s a brief summary of the talks along with links to the presentation decks, and the full meetup recording.
