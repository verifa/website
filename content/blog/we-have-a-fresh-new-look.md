## We've got a fresh new look

Today, we're launching our fresh new look. After five years in business it was time to take a long hard look at ourselves, delving deep into what Verifa is today and where we're headed.

The upshot? A renewed focus on what matters to our customers and to our crew, a new logo, a new visual identity and a new website. Yes, we've been a tad busy.

### A sleek new site

We've simplified our website to make it easier for you to find the info you need. Whether you need a helping hand with your project, a hands-on blog post, or just curious about our crew, we hope our new look website delivers for you. Built in-house with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and guided by the design maestro, [Emanuele Pizzolorusso](https://pizzolorusso.com/about), it's super simple and quick to make changes on our end. This means we can be more agile in delivering great content to you.

### New logo

Our logo has been with us since the beginning, and the company has evolved and grown since those early days. Our new logo needed to reflect and embody what Verifa stands for today. Again going for simplicity, the logo is monochrome and incorporates the infinity symbol, highlighting our focus on continuous everything. We are also evolving a new visual identity using a pastel palette, and emphasising continuous, cloud and people.

### Our purpose: Not your everyday consultancy

At the heart of our rebrand was a deep dive into what Verifa is today, and where we want to go in the future. We focussed in on the true value we offer for our customers and what, as a team, we love to do - Continuous Delivery, Cloud and Open Source.  Essentially Verifa is here to:

- **Help customers define and solve problems**
- **Provide a fun place to do meaningful work**
- **Share knowledge freely with the community**

**TL;DR:** We changed our logo, our look and our website.

Cheers,<br/>
The Verifa crew
