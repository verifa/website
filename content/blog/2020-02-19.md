Interested in Conan? Want to learn more and get some hands-on training? **Come to ConanDays 2020!**

Verifa will be hosting a 3-hour hands-on basic training course in Conan. After several successful projects helping companies adopt Conan we are happy to share our practical experience with all participants and the community!

Also, if you are using Git submodules and considering Conan, we have a 10-min lightning talk on Conan and Git Submodules: Friend or Foe, where we will share our experience on how they can be used together in harmony instead of being considered alternatives, as is the typical view.
