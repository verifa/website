**Helsinki HashiCorp User Group is a meetup full of interesting talks and insights about all things HashiCorp, plus a chance to connect with fellow professionals and hobbyists alike.**

Our friends over at [Siili Solutions](https://www.siili.com/fi/) very kindly hosted the sixth Helsinki HUG, held on 19th April. We gathered at their HQ to listen to talks from Valosan and Siili Solutions, plus some chat, food and drinks. The event was also live streamed for people joining online.

Here’s a brief summary of the talks along with links to the presentation decks, and the full meetup recording.
