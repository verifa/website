**During a one day workshop, Verifa helped a Nordic software development company design a reliable High Available elastic cluster for improved debugging and regulatory compliance.**

***

## The challenge

The company is a leading provider of business software solutions. They needed a way to retain and maintain logs for longer periods for debugging and regulatory purposes. They decided to deploy an Elastic Stack within their private cloud for this purpose and needed additional expertise to ensure a successful implementation.

## The solution

After an initial consultation to identify the scope and focus areas, Verifa delivered a short training session followed by a 1 day workshop. In the workshop we explored, planned and designed a reliable High Available elastic cluster together. The aim of the sessions was knowledge transfer so that future maintenance of the elastic cluster can be carried out by the companyâ€™s own engineers.

## Results

Following the workshop, the team was able to provision new clusters and expand the cluster size based on their needs. In the longer term, they feel confident in monitoring the cluster, and performing upgrades when necessary.
