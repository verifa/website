**Verifa continues to help Jabra on their DevOps journey for their new Android-based video collaboration products.**

***

## The challenge

[Jabra](https://www.jabra.com/) is a part of [GN Group](https://www.gn.com/), a Danish company specialising in hearing, audio, video, and gaming solutions. For the last 150 years, GN has engineered technology that brings people closer to what is most important to them.

Quality and user experience are always at the forefront at GN. They recognised the need for additional expertise to help with setting up a continuous integration and vendor integration process for a new video collaboration product while transitioning from small software projects to a more complex Android system. This project was a cross-site collaboration between teams in multiple countries, for instance Denmark and US, so streamlining different working methodologies was also needed.

## The solution

In an environment that required a blend of coaching and technical support, we took on the role of hands-on technical coach, where we focused on implementing technical improvements and improving the developer teams way-of-working. Our aim was to work with the team to understand the specific problems while at the same time providing tailored solutions.

To this end, we employed methods such as [Value Stream Mapping](https://verifa.io/services/assessments/value-streams/) and later on, Wardley Maps. For instance, the implementation of SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) was a significant step towards overcoming the challenges of traceability of code changes and work items.

We also focused on moving their development to adopt sound continuous delivery principles in an incremental way, while supporting this with better automation tools.

## Results

The introduction of continuous delivery principles and SBOM for all produced items significantly streamlined the development process and greatly enhanced traceability. These process improvements not only expedited the workflows but also simplified them, making it easier for the team to deliver quality outputs efficiently.

Following the success of this standalone project, Verifa's role expanded to cover the new Android-based video collaboration products, leading automation efforts, and introducing and implementing platform teams.
