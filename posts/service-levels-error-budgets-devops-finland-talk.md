**A talk at DevOps Finland on what different Service Level concepts mean and how a software development team could use them effectively in the software delivery process.**

## Abstract

Developer's make changes. Operations want to keep systems stable. Service Levels exists as a concept to tie these seemingly contradictory goals together. But it is mostly represented in literature and understood as an extension to monitoring, which tends to fall under the operations domain. This fundamental-level talk explains Service levels, Error Budgets and related topics through the lens of an end-user oriented developer team who want to provide their customers with the user experience they yearn for.

## What’s covered?

- Service Level Agreements, Objectives and Indicators
- What to measure?
- Why should the development team care about measurements?
- Error budgets
