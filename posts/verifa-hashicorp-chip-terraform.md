Back in June this year we got [our badge for Vault](/blog/verifa-hashicorp-chip-vault-blog/). And now you’ll be pleased to hear that we’re also a Certified HashiCorp Implementation Partner for Terraform!

The HashiCorp software suite including Vault, Terraform, Consul, Vagrant, Packer, and Nomad, helps organisations deliver consistent workflows to provision, secure, connect, and run any infrastructure for any application.

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is an open-source infrastructure as code tool that enables you to safely and predictably create, change, and improve infrastructure. It lets you define both cloud and on-prem resources in human-readable configuration files that you can version, reuse, and share. You can then use a consistent workflow to provision and manage all of your infrastructure throughout its lifecycle.

>‘We’re delighted to now be Certified HashiCorp Implementation Partners for both Vault and Terraform. We use the Hashi-stack tools on a daily basis to solve problems for our customers. It’s nice to get this recognition, and continue to work together with HashiCorp to help our customers with all things Continuous and Cloud.’
